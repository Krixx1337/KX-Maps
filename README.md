# KX-Maps
Official repository of teleport files made by the [KX Trainer](https://krixx.xyz/) community. These files are used for exploring the maps much easier in Guild Wars 2!

## Usage
To use these files, you need to have a paid version of KX Trainer. If you have it, you need to clone this repository and replace your `Maps` folder with the one from here. Then you need to load the desired file in the trainer and start teleporting.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. If you think that there is something missing you can always make your own teleports using KX Trainer map-making system and open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Map Requests
If you want us to add a specific file, please simply open an issue with the label "request". Before you do that, you should make sure that your requested file doesn't exist yet!

## Contact
If you are a paid member of the KX Trainer, you can contact us on our Discord.
