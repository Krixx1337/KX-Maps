# KX-Maps

Official repository of teleport files created for the **[premium KX Trainer](https://kxtools.xyz/)**. These community-made files help you explore maps more efficiently in Guild Wars 2!

## Usage
To use these files, you need an active license for the **[premium version of KX Trainer](https://kxtools.xyz/)**. Once you have it, simply clone this repository, replace your local `Maps` folder with the one from here, and load the desired file in the trainer to start exploring.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. If you think that there is something missing you can always make your own teleports using the KX Trainer map-making system and open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Map Requests
If you want us to add a specific file, please simply open an issue with the label "request." Before you do that, you should make sure that your requested file doesn't exist yet!
